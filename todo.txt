- version control - what if we need to modify the API and that results in a breaking change? Might we add /v1/prefix to all our routes to start with?
- Authentication - Unless this is a free/public API, we probably need some authentication - suggest JSON web tokens
- etags - if we are building something that needs to scale
- Refactoring! lots!
- Create pacakges for several of these files, such as some JSON helpers, decorators, handlers and more
- Testing...

- remember to send back proper status codes, content headers etc
